          <p>
            You have successfully installed XAMPP on this system! Now you can
            start using Apache, MariaDB, PHP and other components. You can find
            more info in the <a className="important">FAQs</a> section or check
            the <a className="important">HOW-TO Guides </a> for getting started
            with PHP applications. <br />
            <br /> XAMPP is meant only for development purposes. It has certain
            configuration settings that make it easy to develop locally but that
            are insecure if you want to have your installation accessible to
            others. If you want have your XAMPP accessible from the internet,
            make sure you understand the implications and you checked the
            <a className="important"> FAQs </a>
            to learn how to protect your site. Alternatively you can use
            <a className="important"> WAMP </a>,
            <a className="important"> MAMP </a>
            or <a className="important"> LAMP </a> which are similar packages
            which are more suitable for production. <br />
            <br />
            Start the XAMPP Control Panel to check the server status. <br />
